## Who

I am a programmer and [cypherpunk](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html). I fell in love with programming in 1995, with [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/) in 2011, and most recently with [Monero](https://getmonero.org/) in 2017.

I prefer to reason from first principles. I tend to see through the bullshit and manage technical trade-offs well. Here is my [github](https://github.com/qertoip), [twitter](https://twitter.com/qertoip), [reddit](https://reddit.com/u/qertoip), and [medium](https://medium.com/@qertoip).

## Contact

[Signal](https://signal.org/) me at `+48 694 797 487`. Note this number is for Signal only and no other communication (like GSM calls/SMS) will be received.

E-mail is inherently insecure means of communication but if you still feel like it, reach me at [contact@qertoip.com](mailto:contact@qertoip.com). 

Here is [my PGP public key](https://keybase.io/qertoip/pgp_keys.asc?fingerprint=40d292c2f04416800d70297cb4b418c7ec7939ac). Ensure the fingerprint is `40D2 92C2 F044 1680 0D70 297C B4B4 18C7 EC79 39AC` and add it to your keyring.

## Background

* Computer science graduate from Warsaw University of Technology, EiTI.
* Former programmer at European Organization for Nuclear Research.
* Co-founder and 8-years a CTO at successful European fintech startup (large scale scraping of online banking systems across the globe); retired from the position in Feb 2019.
* Open source programmer in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Disclosure

I believe privacy and free speech are basic human rights.

I do research and encourage the use of a variety of anonymity and privacy enhancing technologies, including but not limited to overlay networks like Tor and VPN-s; anonymity enabling operating systems like Whonix, Tails and Qubes OS; financial privacy respecting cryptocurrencies like Monero; privacy techniques like coin-joining; private secure messengers like Signal; and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Bisq.

## Public Services

### Monero public node

If you trust me, you can use my "friends and family" node to connect your Monero wallet (desktop Monero GUI, Android Monerujo, iOS Cake Wallet, etc):

Host: `monero.qertoip.com` Port: `18081`

**or** if you know how to use it:

Onion: `blzchctiibfjfvtukctsydhquucz2oajnxnfc5hh4ix35gyqjhdnaqqd.onion` Port: `18081`

While I take care to **not log** any activity, you should always prefer connecting with VPN or Tor to any 3rd party service.
